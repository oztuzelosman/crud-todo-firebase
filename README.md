# Todo List App

This is basic app that serves need of users to add new todos, delete and edit them. In addition to basic CRUD functionality this app shows weather info based on search via OpenWeatherApp.

In develeopment state I use React as a Javascript Library, pure Css and React Icons.

Note: This app is still under development. The things that I want to add to this app is listed below:

1-) User authorization.
2-) Info button that shows when todo is entered next to crud buttons.
3-) Hiding weather section underneath weather info button.
